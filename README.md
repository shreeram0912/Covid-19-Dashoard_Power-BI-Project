# Covid-19-Dashoard_Power-BI-Project

**Introduction:-**

     This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 cases, death and vaccination rates globally, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO).
     Understanding these metrics is crucial for assessing the pandemic's impact and the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns.
     
**Objectives:-**

1. Data Collection: Gather data on COVID-19 cases death and vaccination rates from Kaggle.com.
2. Trend Analysis: Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases, death and vaccination rates over time.
3. Comparative Analysis: Compare data across different regions and countries to identify patterns and disparities.
4. Impact Assessment: Evaluate the relationship between vaccination rates, COVID-19 cases & death numbers.

**Data Sources:-**

    Example: covid-19 dataset.csv, world vaccination.csv
**Data Preparation:-**

1.Data Cleaning: Process and clean the collected data for consistency and accuracy.
2.Visualization Tools: Use software Power-BI for data visualization.
3.Data Model:-Create a snowflake schema model.
4.Fact Table: COVID-19 cases and vaccination counts (with date, country, and region).
5.Dimension Tables:Geography (Country, Region) Time (Date, Month, Year) Vaccination Types (e.g., types of vaccines administered)
6.Documentation: Compile findings into reports and presentations.

**Dashboard Design:-**

*Arrange visuals in a user-friendly manner, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation.
*Use colors and themes to enhance readability and engagement.
*Include tooltips and data labels for additional context.

**Visualizations:-**

*Use various visualization types to represent data:
*Line Charts: For trends over time (e.g., daily cases and vaccinations).
*Bar Charts: For comparing case numbers across different regions.
*Maps: To visualize case and vaccination data geographically.
*Cards: To show key metrics (e.g., total cases, total vaccinations).
*Slicers: For filtering data by date, country, or vaccination type.

**Expected Outcomes:-**

*A clear understanding of COVID-19 case trends and vaccination rates.
*Identification of factors influencing vaccination uptake and case reductions.
*Recommendations for improving vaccination strategies in underperforming regions.

**How to Use:-**

     *Open the Power BI report file.
     *Explore the dashboard components: Interact with visualizations to gain insights into different aspects of the COVID-19 cases and vaccination rates globally.
      Use filters and slicers: Apply filters to drill down into specific segments of the data.

**Publishing:-**

1.Publish the Power BI report to the Power BI service or Git hub.
2.Use Power BI apps for mobile accessibility.

**Technical Details:-**

    -Power BI Desktop version: 2.137.751.0 64-bit (October, 2024)
    -Session ID: 60c4f1e8-b77c-4e1a-86b6-fad7d1ab5f8a
    -Data model: snowflake schema
    
**Security and Permissions:-**

Implement row-level security if the report will be shared with users who need access to specific data.

**Performance Optimization:-**

Optimize your data model by reducing the size of datasets (e.g., using summarized tables).
Avoid complex DAX calculations in visuals where possible to enhance performance.
